# Walkability and Socioeconomic Disparities: An Analysis of Chapel Hill and Durham

This repository contains data about walkability scores in the region of Chapel Hill-Durham correlated with income statistics. 

## Purpose
Estimating a town's walkability is very important for a variety of reasons, such as judging urban sprawl in an area. It is important to see if there is a correlation between poor walkability and low income in a particular area. By deciding if there is a correlation, it can help developers plan to addrees the discrepancies in accessibility.

## Provenance
Sources of Data:

- [Description of Variables](https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping)
- [User Guide](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/documents/national_walkability_index_methodology_and_user_guide_june2021.pdf)

## Potential
This data and its analysis offers insight into the correlation betwen Chapel Hill's walkability and poverty levels. Although these two cities are higher income, this data still shows the trend between walkability and income in an area. As seen below, when the walkability score is lower (worse), the income of an area is lower as well. From this, a positive linear relationship can be drawn, the better the walkability score, the higher the income of the residents that live there. 

While this relationship can be derived from a variety of factors, such as gentrification, transportation limitations, housing affordability, and urban renewal.

This relationship shows us the need to make the walkability of areas more equitable. Possible solutions include the implementation of 15 minute cities and changing zoning to allow for more mixed use. This would invite a variety of communities to live near one another.

### Visualization
Below shows the direct correltation between the ranking of walkability and the percentage of low income people in the area.

The two graphs below compare the frequency of low income households as well as the walkability of the area. As seen in this graph, there is a relationship between the two variables as they match one another in frequency. Both graphs skew right, peaking in frequency on the lower half of the x-axis
