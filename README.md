# Chapel Hill-Durham Walkability Income Data

This repository contains data about walkability scores in the region of Chapel Hill-Durham correlated with income statistics. 

## Purpose
What is this data for?

## Provenance
Sources of Data:

- [Walkability Index](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/walkability-index7)
- [Description of Variables]([http://www.google.com](https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping))
- [User Guide](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/documents/national_walkability_index_methodology_and_user_guide_june2021.pdf)

## Potential
What might this data, and its analysis, show us?
This data and its analysis offers insight into the correlation betwen Chapel Hill's walkability and poverty levels. Although these two cities are higher income, this data still shows the trend between walkability and income in an area. As seen below, when the walkability score is lower (worse), the income of an area is lower as well. From this, a positive linear relationship can be drawn, the better the walkability score, the higher the income of the residents that live there
